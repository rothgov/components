# Logo / Position

You can use our new logo in a wide range of applications. From different devices and resolutions to full colour print and vehicle liveries.

The logo is versatile and you can use it in different positions, depending upon the purpose.

### Appropriate positioning
The following examples show how the logo can be used. For example, the logo can be positioned in the top right of a newsletter or in the bottom center of a website footer (mobile).

### Clear space

To give the Rotherham Council logo maximum impact, use a safe area of half the height of the Rotherham 'R'.

### Minimum size

Don't use the logo below 128px (8rem) wide on screens. If you need to go smaller, consider using the 'Avatar' version of the logo.

### Don't
- rotate
- distort
- use other fonts
- add straplines
- add service or directorate names
