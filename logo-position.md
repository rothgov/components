# Logo / Position

Although we want to create consistent services and products, our new logo is designed to be used in a wide range of applications. From different screen sizes, orientations and resolutions to full colour print, uniforms and vehicle liveries.

The logo is versatile and can be used in different positions, depending upon the applicaction and purpose.

### Appropriate positioning
The following examples show how the logo can be used. For example, the logo can be positioned in the top right of a newsletter or in the bottom center of a website footer (mobile).

### Clear space

To give the Rotherham Council log maximum impact, use a safe area of half the height of the Rotherham 'R'.

### Minimum size

Don't use the logo below 128px (8rem) on screens. If you need to go smaller, consider using the 'Avatar' version of the logo.

### Don't
- rotate
- distort
- use other fonts
- add straplines
- add service or directorate names
