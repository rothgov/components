# Design principles

A set of principles underpins all our design decisions and guides us when we need to make hard choices. This set is a criteria for what makes good design at the Council and all design patterns are evaluated against it.

## Simple

We achieve simplicity by prioritizing direction over choice. Offer one thought-out optimal path to the user. In most situations, there is a best path, choice or solution. Do research and find out what it is. Do the hard work, so that our users don't have to.

Examples:
- One prominent call to action per screen. For example, in the move out process, it might have been useful to have multiple calls to action but we chose to display the most important one
- One email one message
- One question at a time in the journey, binary questions rather than multiple options
- Simple, consise and straightforward tone of voice.

## Robust

Anyone should be able to understand how it works without an instruction. You just try it out and see what happens. It's easy to undo and impossible to break. And when we say 'anyone' we mean it. The products and services we create should be accessible for all people, regardless of their mental or physical abilities.

Examples:
- Labels are specific to actions, so that they don't need additional instructions
- Chunky buttons and controls, large type, bold but simple colour choices, thick outlines, not bitty, components don't break at different screen sizes
- Robust reusable code

## Personal

Don't be afraid to have fun and experiment. But while you have a license to experiment, empathy for our users is everything. Let our personality show, but be serious when you need to be.

Examples:
- Positive and friendly tone of voice
- Personalizing Ui copy to member's specific circumstances
- Bold simple colours (one tone, flat, no gradients)
- Illustrations with humour
- Using playful metaphors
- Using fun names in code
