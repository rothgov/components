# Spacing

## Grid

### Scale up

We use the browser default font size of 16px to size and space objects. Using multiples of 16 makes scaling for a wide variety of devices easy and consistent.

- 16px (1rem)
- 32px (2rem)
- 64px (4rem)
- 128px (8rem)
- 256px (16rem)

### Scale down

Using the same scale, we can go smaller to size and space objects such as paddings and margins.

- 8px (.5rem)
- 4px (.25rem)
- 2px (.125rem)

### Not sure what a 'rem' unit is?

A 'rem' unit is equal to the computed value of font-size on the root element.
