# Colour / Primary

Use the Councils colour palette:
- to draw users’ focus to particular content areas
- to give emphasis, depth and highlight to our work where needed
- in the right context — for example dont use large amounts of colour in a form, it can distract the user
- with restraint — users can read content better when we use limited colour
to help convey meaning to interaction patterns, for example, for mandatory form fields. Never use colour alone to do this.
