# Introduction

## Design, develop, and deliver
Use the Council's end-to-end design language to create straightforward and beautiful experiences.

We are aiming to create familiarity across our services. Familiarity makes things quicker and easier for our users â€” it helps them understand our services and trust us.

## Getting started
Our design system is made up of principles, guidelines and tools that help us design and build user-centered council services.
