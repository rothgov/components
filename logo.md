# Logo

The 'Rotherham Council' logo is less formal than our previous logo. Although we are still a 'Metropolitan Borough' Council, our new logo is representitive of how our customers refer to us.

Our Logo has been specially drawn and should not been represented with any other typeface.

Available in various formats:
- Colour (coming soon)
