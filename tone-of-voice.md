# Tone of voice

The way we write and speak says a lot about us. It tells people whether we're confident, or uncertain. Friendly, or aloof. Informal, or uptight. We don't want to create the wrong impression. So we need to watch our words.

## Writing principles

### Simple

Simplicity is the key to how we work. And the key to our language. Nice simple words. Short, simple sentences. Everything clear as day. This is harder than it sounds. But it's what we're here for, so we need to make sure we live by it. Take the time to edit your writing. What can you cut? (It's amazing how much you can.) Which words could be simpler, or more straightforward?

- Concise writing – use short to moderate length sentences and remove all excess words
- The [Inverted Pyramid Principle](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/inverted-pyramids-in-cyberspace/) – respect our reader's time by starting with the answer

### Straightforward

It's not about dumbing down, it's about communicating clearly. We explain complex things in simple terms. This emphasises our expertise. Even little things make a big difference – like saying 'to' instead of 'in order to', or 'also' instead of 'in addition to'.

- Specific language – tell the reader what they need to know now
- No jargon or pretentious words – use simple, everyday language

### Friendly

We speak in a normal, non-corporate voice – the voice of a friend. So we say 'you' (not 'customers') and 'we' (not 'the council'). We use contractions like 'you're' and 'we'll'. We start sentences with 'And' (gasp). And we're fun. We throw in the odd quip, or aside. (Like 'Your account balance is looking healthy. Hooray!') People should enjoy hearing from us and talking to us.

- Down-to-earth – use personal words and contractions
- Be yourself – use a conversational tone, don't be a Council robot

### Positive

We don't grumble about what's wrong. We just do what's right. People are canny enough to make their own comparisons.

- Eternal optimism – focus on the positive
- Proactive, not passive – use the active voice
- Strong verbs – convey action and limit use of modifiers and suffixes

### Open

We tell people the truth. And we don't try to hide things. So our language should be open and clear: no weasel words, no confusing jargon or management speak. Try to avoid having to add asterisks and footnotes. Always look to translate technical stuff into everyday language. And if we have to use a technical term, make the effort to explain it.

- Explicit references – make it clear who or what we're talking about
- Data – write from an informed, knowledgeable viewpoint

## Do this, not this
- it's not it is
- we're not we are
- you've not you have
- we not I
- live not reside
- member not customer
- usual not expected
- sort it out not resolve
- device / something in your home not appliance
- to not in order to
- because not due to
- we'll not we reserve the right to
- we'll send you not you will receive
- because not owing to
- my bill's too high not my bill is higher than expected
- affordable not cheap
