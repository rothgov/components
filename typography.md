## Typography principles

- Base font size and container widths are optimised for ideal line length: 50-75 characters
- Left align all paragraph text and headings when they appear with paragraph text. Centred alignment is ok for standalone headings and short subheadings only
- Always provide sufficient colour contrast with background: minimum 3.0 colour ratio

## Type Scale

To create an easily readable interface, you don't need lots of font-sizes. A simple ratio-based scale with around 7 options should be enough.

Our font scale is based on the default browser size of 16px.

- 48px (3rem)
- 36px/2.25rem
- 24px/1.5rem
- 20px/1.25rem
- 16px/1rem
- 14px/.875rem
- 12px/.75rem

If you need larger font sizes for creating large format prints, use the ratio-based scale to go larger.

## Line Height

### Body copy
To ensure clear ligibility, line height for body copy should be set at 1.5 (150%)

### Headings
To ensure headings have impact, line height for headings should be set at 1.2 (120%)
