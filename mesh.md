## Mesh supergraphic in use
The supergraphic has the most impact when it's used in full colour. When used on white, the supergraphics can be placed over the top of each other in contrasting colours to add depth. Use a pink background with a navy supergraphic as the primary brand application. Never mix secondary colours in supergraphics.
